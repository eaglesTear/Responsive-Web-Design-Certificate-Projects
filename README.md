# Responsive-Web-Design-Certificate-Projects
A collection of web pages that I designed and developed for my FreeCodeCamp RWD Certification.

There were 5 tasks corresponding to five different pages. 
Each page had different design specs and facets of code to include such as ids, media queries and semantic HTML5 markup etc.

Work is submitted and marked electronically.

The technical documentation page on Ruby is my favourite. I like both the design, clarity and colour scheme.
